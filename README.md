# Matthew Peters

Founder of [Appcat](https://appcat.io), the first Lovable template shop.

Every Appcat template is built on the Appcat Method: professional architecture, a design system, realistic mock data, and all the context Lovable needs. Works with Lovable Cloud and Supabase. All the conventions an experienced developer would apply, already done.

The only thing left is your idea.

## What I build

**Appcat.** Production-ready Lovable templates delivered as complete products. Not just a remix link. Architecture decided, design system included, AI already oriented to the codebase, guided lessons from remix to production.

**Appcat Builds.** A YouTube series documenting how these templates are made. Every prompt, every decision, every place where something breaks.

**Soundlink.** A music platform built for artists who care about how their work is experienced. Currently in development.

**Visibilityradar.** SEO and visibility tooling for indie builders. Currently in development.
